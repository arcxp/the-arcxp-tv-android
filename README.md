for the resizer requirement, you will need to provide a resizer key If you donâ€™t have it, please contact your Technical Delivery Manager (TDM). Your key should not be shared or made public.

you can place it in local.properties file at root of project resizer_key = XXXXX

This is required to avoid downloading larger images than necessary and thus incurring unnecessary bandwidth costs.
